# ‚ìçTTS
‚ìçTTS is a Voice generation model that lets you clone voices into different languages by using just a quick 6-second audio clip. Built on Tortoise,
‚ìçTTS has important model changes that make cross-language voice cloning and multi-lingual speech generation super easy.
There is no need for an excessive amount of training data that spans countless hours.

This is the same model that powers [Coqui Studio](https://coqui.ai/), and [Coqui API](https://docs.coqui.ai/docs), however we apply
a few tricks to make it faster and support streaming inference.

### Features
- Supports 14 languages. 
- Voice cloning with just a 6-second audio clip.
- Emotion and style transfer by cloning. 
- Cross-language voice cloning.
- Multi-lingual speech generation.
- 24khz sampling rate.

### Languages
As of now, XTTS-v1 (v1.1) supports 14 languages: **English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese,
Polish, Turkish, Russian, Dutch, Czech, Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese**.

Stay tuned as we continue to add support for more languages. If you have any language requests, please feel free to reach out!

### Code
The current implementation supports inference and [fine-tuning](https://tts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/xtts.html#training).

Using üê∏TTS API:

```python
from TTS.api import TTS
tts = TTS("tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v1", gpu=True)

# generate speech by cloning a voice using default settings
tts.tts_to_file(text="It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it I'm not going to be silent.",
                file_path="output.wav",
                speaker_wav="/path/to/target/speaker.wav",
                language="en")

# generate speech by cloning a voice using custom settings
tts.tts_to_file(text="It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it I'm not going to be silent.",
                file_path="output.wav",
                speaker_wav="/path/to/target/speaker.wav",
                language="en",
                decoder_iterations=30)
```

Using üê∏TTS Command line:

```console
 tts --model_name tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/xtts_v1 \
     --text "Bug√ºn okula gitmek istemiyorum." \
     --speaker_wav /path/to/target/speaker.wav \
     --language_idx tr \
     --use_cuda true
```

Using model directly:

```python
from TTS.tts.configs.xtts_config import XttsConfig
from TTS.tts.models.xtts import Xtts

config = XttsConfig()
config.load_json("/path/to/xtts/config.json")
model = Xtts.init_from_config(config)
model.load_checkpoint(config, checkpoint_dir="/path/to/xtts/", eval=True)
model.cuda()

outputs = model.synthesize(
    "It took me quite a long time to develop a voice and now that I have it I am not going to be silent.",
    config,
    speaker_wav="/data/TTS-public/_refclips/3.wav",
    gpt_cond_len=3,
    language="en",
)
```
